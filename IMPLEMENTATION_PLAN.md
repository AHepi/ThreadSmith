# ThreadSmith Restoration Plan

Document status: reconstructed on 2026-07-22 for the Foundation/PC1 recovery only.

| Gate | Definition of done | Repair limit | State |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Inventory | Every supplied artifact is hashed, classified, and assigned an exact, inferred, or unresolved path. | 0 | Complete |
| Minimum reconstruction | Only the recovered two-crate Rust workspace, PC1 vectors, ADR, and durable recovery state exist. | 2 | Complete |
| Verification | Format, workspace check, Clippy with denied warnings, locked/offline checks, Foundation tests, PC1 tests, conformance vectors, and recovered-byte hashes pass. | 2 | Complete |
| Read-only acceptance | A separate reviewer finds no P0 or P1 restoration defect and confirms Foundation/PC1 boundaries. | 2 | Complete after repair cycle 1 |
| Provenance anchor | The commit containing this accepted tree and tag `threadsmith-foundation-pc1-reconstructed-0.1` form the new anchor; remote ref verification is recorded outside this self-referential tree. | 0 | Delivery gate |

The active scope excludes PC2 and every parser, YAML, compiler, runtime, builder, planner, provider, UI, CLI/MCP, and Android concern. The next bounded task after this baseline is `PC2 parser-dependency intake and semantic freeze`; it is not authorized within this restoration.
